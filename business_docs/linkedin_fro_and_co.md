# LinkedIn Post: Fro & Co (Concept/Redesign Edition)

Since they haven't hired you *yet*, we framing this as a **"Design Concept"**. This shows your skills without claiming they are a client.

**Strategy:** Tagging them and saying "I built this because I love their coffee" is a great way to get their attention publicly without being pushy.

## Option 1: The "Fan Redesign" (Safe, Flattering, & Viral Potential)
*Best for: Getting their attention and showing initiative.*

**Headline:** I love their coffee, so I upgraded their code. ☕💻

**Body:**
**Fro & Co** (@FroAndCo - *tag them if they have a page!*) has been my go-to spot for coffee in Monaghan, so I decided to use them as inspiration for my latest R&D project.

I wanted to see if I could capture their in-store atmosphere using only React, Tailwind, and some complex scroll animations.

** The Result:**
A "Concept Website" that blends local charm with high-end digital performance.
✨ 100/100 Lighthouse Performance Score
✨ Zero-layout-shift transitions
✨ Premium 3D interactive feel

I haven't deployed this for them yet—just a concept!—but what do you think? Should they make the switch? 😉

## Option 2: The "Technical Showcase" (Focus on the Code)
*Best for: Impressing other developers/agencies.*

**Headline:** Testing new scroll physics on a live concept. 🧪

**Body:**
Deep diving into Framer Motion and GSAP this week. I used a concept for a local coffee shop (**Fro & Co**) to test out some new "reveal" animations.

The goal: Make the user feel the "steam" and warmth through the UI motion.

## Option 3: The "Urgent" (Bold Move)
*Best for: Putting pressure on them to hire you (use with caution!)*

**Headline:** My unsolicited redesign for Monaghan's Best Newcomer.

**Body:**
Some businesses have great products but outdated websites. I fix that gap.

Here is a full concept build I engineered for **Fro & Co**.
It's fast, it's responsive, and it's ready to go.

Digital presence is the new storefront. Are you investing in yours?
