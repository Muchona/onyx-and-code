# Email Draft: The Batch Loaf Concept

**Subject:** Website Concept for The Batch Loaf (Following my visit)

**Body:**

Hi [Manager Name],

I stopped by The Batch Loaf earlier today to drop off some info, but I missed you! I obtained your email from the staff instead.

I’m a local digital developer (based here in Monaghan), and as a fan of the restaurant, I actually built a **modern website concept** for The Batch Loaf to show what your digital presence *could* look like.

**You can see the concept here:**

**Why I built this:**
I noticed your current online presence doesn't fully capture the high-end artisan vibe of the bistro. I wanted to build something that feels as premium as the food you serve.

**My Proposal:**
I run a **"Website as a Service"** model:
*   **€0 Upfront Cost** for the design/build.
*   **Simple Monthly Fee** that covers hosting, updates, and tech support.
*   You get a world-class site without the massive agency price tag.

If you like the concept link above, I’d love to grab a coffee (your place!) and chat about making it live for you.

Best,

**[Your Name]**
