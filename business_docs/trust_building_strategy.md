# The "Trust Protocol": Converting Skeptics into Clients

It is normal to feel discouraged, but **silence does not mean "No."** It usually means "I'm busy" or "I don't understand."

Restaurant managers are bombarded with scams (SEO salesman, fake reviews, etc.). When you say "Free Design," their alarm bells ring because it sounds too good to be true.

Here is how we prove you are the real deal.

## 1. The "Human Proof" (Video Walkthrough)
Sending a link is good. Sending a **video of you** talking about their site is 10x better. It proves you are a real local person, not a bot.

**The Strategy:**
Use a free tool like **Loom** (or record your screen).
1.  Open their "Concept Website" on your screen.
2.  Record your voice (and face if you're comfortable).
3.  Walk through the site for 45 seconds.

**Script:**
> "Hey [Manager Name], it's [Your Name] from Monaghan—the guy who stopped by yesterday.
>
> I didn't want you to think this was just some spam link, so I recorded this quick video to show you what I actually built for The Batch Loaf.
>
> Check out how I organized the menu here... and see how this reservation button works on mobile? I built this specifically to help you guys execute service faster on weekends.
>
> It's real, it's ready, and I'd love to hand it over to you. Let me know what you think."

**Why this works:** Scammers don't make custom videos. Professionals do.

## 2. The "Physical Anchor" (Business Card/Paper)
When you visit in person, do you leave something physical?
*   If they forget your name, they can't Google you.
*   **Action:** If you don't have business cards, print a simple "Concept QR Code" sheet.
    *   "I built a digital concept for [Restaurant Name]. Scan to view."
    *   Leave this with the host/hostess for the manager.

## 3. The "Busy Manager" Follow-Up Rule
They aren't ignoring you; they are likely fixing a broken dishwasher or covering a shift.

**The Rule of 3:**
1.  **Day 0:** The Visit (In person).
2.  **Day 1:** The Email (The link/video).
3.  **Day 4:** The "Nudge" (Friendly bump).

**"The Nudge" Email Draft:**
> **Subject:** One last thought on the website
>
> Hi [Manager Name],
>
> Im sure the restaurant is crazy busy right now, so I wont keep flooding your inbox!
>
> Just wanted to double-check if you managed to peek at that concept link? Even if you aren't looking to switch right now, I'd honestly love your feedback on the design just as a local business owner.
>
> Best,
> [Your Name]

## 4. Social Proof (The Mirror)
Before they reply, they **WILL** Google you.
*   Does your LinkedIn profile look active? (We are fixing this).
*   Does your Facebook have posts?
*   **Action:** Post that "Fro & Co" video on your LinkedIn/Facebook **TODAY**. Even if Fro & Co hasn't hired you, seeing that you are active and doing work makes you look "safe" to the Batch Loaf manager.
