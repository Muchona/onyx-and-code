# Proposal Strategy: The "HenParty" Clone
**Target Site:** `henparty.ie`
**Type:** Directory & Booking Platform

## 1. The Reality (What they are asking for)
`henparty.ie` is NOT just a standard website. It is a **Platform**.
It includes:
*   **Database:** Locations, Activities, Hotels, Packages.
*   **Search Engine:** "Find activities in Kilkenny for 20 people".
*   **Booking System:** Managing deposits and payments.
*   **User Accounts:** Bridesmaids logging in to pay their share.
*   **Supplier Portal:** Businesses logging in to update their ads.

**Estimated Cost for Custom Build:** €15,000 - €30,000+
**Estimated Time:** 3-6 Months.

## 2. The Danger (Don't fall into this trap!)
If you say *"Yes, I can build this"* and charge them €2,000, **you will go bankrupt**.
You will spend 6 months coding complex logic for no money.

**The Strategy:**
You need to find out **WHY** they want this site.
*   Do they want to *compete* with HenParty.ie? (Huge budget needed).
*   Or do they just want to *list their own activities*? (Simple website).

---

## 3. The "Smart MVP" Pitch (Website as a Service)
Pitch them a **Phase 1** version that looks exactly like HenParty.ie but functions simply.

**The Solution:**
*   **Design:** Beautiful, searchable directory (Visually stunning).
*   **Function:** Instead of a complex "Booking Engine," use a **"Quote Engine"**.
    *   User builds a package -> Clicks "Get Quote" -> Client receives email -> Client sends invoice manually.
    *   **Benefit:** Saves you 200 hours of coding payment logic.

**Your Offer:**
*   **Setup Fee:** €2,500 (This is complex, do not do it for €0 upfront).
*   **Monthly:** €150/month (Maintenance & Hosting).

## 4. The "2-Page Compact Platform" (The Most Likely Winner)
The client says they want "2 Pages" but "Look like HenParty.ie". This is a contradiction, but here is the solution:

*   **Page 1 (The "Platform" Illusion):**
    *   Large Hero Video (like the original).
    *   "Featured Packages" Grid (photos look clickable, but open a simple popup).
    *   "Why Choose Us" section.
    *   All content lives on one long scrolling page, making it feel "big" without the cost of 500 sub-pages.
*   **Page 2 (The Hook):**
    *   A sophisticated "Get Quote" form.

**Price:** €1,500 - €2,500.

## 5. Specific Questions to Ask the Client
Copy and paste this to them (or ask in person):

> "To give you an accurate quote, could you clarify these 3 things?
>
> 1.  You mentioned **'2 Pages'** but also **'Like HenParty.ie'** (which has 5,000 pages). Do you strictly want just a Home & Contact page for now, or do you need a searchable database of activities?

## 6. Project B: The Online Store (Shopify)
The client also wants to "sell products" (Ecommerce).
*   **The Answer:** YES, we use **Shopify**.
*   **The Strategy:** Do not "code" an online store from scratch (it takes months). We set up a Shopify store, apply a premium theme, and customize it to look like Onyx & Code quality.
*   **Price:** €1,500 - €3,000 Setup.

**Questions for the Store:**

## 7. Project C: "Google Reservations"
The client wants "Google Reservation" on the website.
*   **Clarification:** You cannot "build" a Google Reservation system yourself.
*   **How it works:** Google adds that blue "Reserve a Table" button automatically IF the restaurant uses a partner partner like **OpenTable**, **Resy**, **SevenRooms**, or **Mozrest**.
*   **The Strategy:**
    1.  If they **already have** OpenTable/Resy: We just embed their widget on the new site. (Easy).
    2.  If they **don't have** a system: We can set up a simple free booking system (like **TableAgent**) which integrates with Google.

**Questions for Reservations:**
> 7. "Do you currently use a digital reservation book (like OpenTable or Resy) inside the restaurant, or is it pen and paper?"
> 8. "When you say 'Google Reservation', do you mean the **blue button on Google Maps**, or just a booking form on your website?"

**Technical Note on your Screenshot (Eveve):**
*   Your screenshot shows the system is powered by **Eveve**.
*   **WARNING:** You cannot "embed" that specific Google Reserve URL directly inside your website (Google blocks it for security, it will show a white box).
*   **The Fix:** You must ask the client for their **Eveve Widget Code**. We can embed *that* directly on the site, and it will look native (just like we did with ResDiary for Jimmy's).
