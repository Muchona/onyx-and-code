# Social Media Content Strategy: Andy's Bar (Project Alex)

## 🟦 ONE: LinkedIn (The Visionary Architect)
**Focus:** Professional authority, technical mastery, business value of immersive web.

**Headline:** redefining the digital showroom. 60FPS or nothing.

**Body:**
Just wrapped initial development on **Project Alex (Andy's Bar)**—a high-fidelity exploration into the future of e-commerce.

We're moving beyond static grids. The modern web demands **spatial awareness** and **fluid narrative**. This isn't just a website; it’s a **digital showroom** engineered for immersion.

**The Architecture:**
⚡ **React Three Fiber (R3F)** for the 3D environment.
🎨 **Tailwind CSS v4** for next-gen styling tokens.
🎬 **GSAP ScrollTrigger** for physics-based narrative pacing.
💎 **"Deep Space Glass"** aesthetic doctrine.

The goal? To merge rigid engineering with visual purity. A mandatory 60FPS performance gate on all interactions.

The web is evolving. Are you building for the future, or just maintaining the past?

**Option B (Storytelling):**
Building the "Deep Space Glass" aesthetic.
Andy's Bar isn't a website—it's a scroll-driven narrative.
Every pixel engineered. Every frame calculated.
The future of the web is immersive.

**Focus:** Fast, technical, confident.

**Draft 1:**
Stop building static websites.
Project Alex (Andy's Bar) is proof of concept:
— React Three Fiber
— GSAP ScrollTrigger
— Tailwind v4
— 60FPS mandatory.

The browser is a canvas, not a document. 🚀

**Draft 2:**
Just shipped the motion logic for Andy's Bar.
Merging rigid engineering with "Deep Space Glass" aesthetics.
If it drops below 60FPS, it doesn't ship. That's the Onyx standard. 💎
