# Introduction Email: New Restaurant Lead

Here are two options. Since you met them in person, the "Personal" approach usually works best.

## Option 1: The "Service" Pitch (Standard & Professional)
*Best if you want to push the "Monthly Subscription / No Upfront Cost" model.*

**Subject:** Great meeting you today / Website for [Restaurant Name]

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

It was great meeting you earlier today! Thanks for taking a moment to chat.

As I mentioned, I run **Onyx & Code**, a local digital agency here in Monaghan. I noticed that your current digital presence [doesn't do your food justice / could be working harder for you], and I’d love to help you fix that.

**How we are different:**
Most agencies charge thousands upfront and then disappear. We operate on a **"Website as a Service"** model:
✅ **€0 Upfront Design Cost** – You don't pay until the site is live.
✅ **Low Monthly Fee** – Includes hosting, maintenance, and unlimited updates.
✅ **Premium 3D Design** – A modern, mobile-first experience that actually drives reservations.

I’d love to show you a quick concept of what your site *could* look like.

Are you free for a 10-minute chat later this week?

Best regards,

## Option 2: The "Premium" Pitch (Visionary)
*Best if they seemed interested in a high-end, custom design.*

**Subject:** Elevating the digital experience for [Restaurant Name]

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

Great meeting you today at the restaurant.

I’ve been thinking about what we discussed. Your space has such a great atmosphere, and your digital "front door" (your website) should feel just as welcoming and premium.

At **Onyx & Code**, we don't use generic templates. We architect **digital experiences**.
I specialize in building high-performance websites for hospitality brands that capture the "vibe" of the venue before a guest even books a table.

**What I can do for you:**
*   **Custom Design:** Tailored specifically to your brand identity.
*   **Mobile-First:** 70% of your customers are on phones; we make sure it looks perfect there.
*   **Interactive Menu:** Beautiful, easy-to-read, and appetizing.

I’d love to stop by again and show you some examples of our work (like **Fro & Co** and **Jimmy's Bar**).

Let me know what you think.

Best,

**[Your Name]**
