Hi [Name],

I hope you're having a busy week!

I’m just circling back on the website concept I showed you. I'm currently updating my agency portfolio and LinkedIn with some of my latest "High-Performance" concepts, and I was planning to feature this Fro & Co design as a case study of what’s possible for local businesses.

**Before I post it publicly as a concept, I wanted to check in with you first.**

If you are interested in making this your *actual* live website, I’d love to hand over the keys and get it deployed for you properly.

Have you had a chance to discuss with your current developer?

Best,

**[Your Name]**
Onyx & Code
