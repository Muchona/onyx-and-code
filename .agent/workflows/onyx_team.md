# Onyx Team Initialization Protocol

1.  **System Check**:
    *   Assess project structure.
    *   Verify existence of `design_system.md`. If missing, flagging it for creation by Agent A.
    *   Verify 3D environment readiness (e.g., `Scene3D.tsx`, installed dependencies like `three`, `@react-three/fiber`).

2.  **Agent Assembly**:
    *   **Agent A (UI/UX)**: Stand by for "Deep Space Glass" styling and "Premium Standard" checks.
    *   **Agent B (3D)**: Stand by for 60fps performance monitoring and Scene formulation.

3.  **Announcement**:
    *   Notify the user that the Onyx Team is assembled.
    *   Report status of Design System and 3D Core.
    *   Await tactical directives.

*Use this workflow whenever the user invokes "Onyx Team" or similar commands.*
